1. Explain the importance of Namenode in Hadoop cluster
2. Practice the beginners commands for HDFS 
ANS-
1)  
The NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system. It keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system, 
and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept. It does not store the data of these files itself.

Client applications talk to the NameNode whenever they wish to locate a file, or when they want to add/copy/move/delete a file. 
The NameNode responds the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives.

The NameNode is a Single Point of Failure for the HDFS Cluster. HDFS is not currently a High Availability system. 
When the NameNode goes down, the file system goes offline. There is an optional SecondaryNameNode that can be hosted on a separate machine.
It only creates checkpoints of the namespace by merging the edits file into the fsimage file and does not provide any real redundancy. 
Hadoop 0.21+ has a BackupNameNode that is part of 
a plan to have an HA name service, but it needs active contributions from the people who want it to make it Highly Available.

IMPORTANT CHARACTERSTICS OF NAMENODE:-

1)NameNode is the centerpiece of  HDFS.

2)NameNode is also known as the Master

3)NameNode only stores the metadata of HDFS â€“ the directory tree of all files in the file system, and tracks the files across the cluster.

4)NameNode does not store the actual data or the dataset. The data itself is actually stored in the DataNodes.

5)NameNode knows the list of the blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS. With this information NameNode knows how to construct the file from blocks.

6)NameNode is so critical to HDFS and when the NameNode is down, HDFS/Hadoop cluster is inaccessible and considered down.

7)NameNode is a single point of failure in Hadoop cluster.

8)NameNode is usually configured with a lot of memory (RAM). Because the block locations are help in main memory.
